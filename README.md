# Transcription-Templated Assembly of the Nucleolus in *C. elegans* Embryo

This repository contains the code and theoretical models for the paper "Transcription-Templated Assembly of the Nucleolus in the *C. elegans* Embryo" by Nishant Kodan et al. The study explores how the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) drives nucleolar assembly in early *C. elegans* embryos.



## Contents
- **Paper_Codes.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the code for simulations and analysis of nucleolar assembly dynamics.
- **Experimental_Data:** Experimental data used to measure model parameters and comparisons.
- **Kodan.et.al.2024.06.06.pdf:** Preprint of the paper.
- **README.md:** This file.

## Overview
The nucleolus is a biomolecular condensate that forms through phase separation within the nucleus. This study presents a model where active transcription of rRNA drives the assembly of the nucleolus, contrasting with the traditional view of passive phase separation.

## Key Features
- **Active Transcription-Templated Assembly Model:** This model explains the rapid kinetics of nucleolar assembly observed in early *C. elegans* embryos.
- **Comparison with Experimental Data:** The model's predictions are quantitatively compared with fluorescence microscopy data.
- **RNAi Perturbations:** The effect of different RNAi perturbations on nucleolar size and assembly dynamics is studied.
